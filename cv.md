Time to win the lottery!
Given a lottery ticket (ticket), represented by an array of 2-value arrays, you must find out if you've won the jackpot.

```function bingo(ticket, win){
  var count = 0;

  ticket.forEach(game => {
    if (game[0].includes(String.fromCharCode(game[1]))) {
      count++;
    }
  });

  return (count >= win) ? "Winner!" : "Loser!";
}
```
